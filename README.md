# Color-Object-Detection
This project enables real-time detection of user-defined color objects using a webcam. Users enter a color name, and the program identifies objects matching that color by converting it to its HSV range, applying a mask, and detecting contours. It's a practical tool for object tracking, sorting, and interactive applications.
